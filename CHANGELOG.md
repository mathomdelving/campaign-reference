## [2025-01-24 PM] - UI Redesign & Search Improvements

### Added

#### "By Candidate" View (Complete Redesign)
- **New unified view** combining Candidate Profile and Compare functionality
- **Search bar** with intelligent word-based matching
  - Searches across both "LAST, FIRST" and "First Last" formats
  - Multi-word search (e.g., "Mark Kelly" finds "KELLY, MARK E")
  - Searches candidate names and states simultaneously
- **Batch data fetching** to load all 2,866 candidates (previously limited to 1,000)
- **Party filter buttons** (All, Democrats, Republicans, Third Party)
- **Ranked candidate display** with metrics
  - Shows rank number, party dot, formatted name, location, and metric value
  - Dynamic sorting by selected metric
- **Remove buttons** (X) to deselect candidates
- **Quarterly trend chart** using same component as District view
- **Formatted name display** - Shows "Mark Kelly" instead of "KELLY, MARK E"

#### District View Enhancements
- **Party filter buttons** added to District view
- **Ranked candidate list** with metric values
  - Displays as: "#1. ðŸ”µ Candidate Name ($5.2M)"
  - Auto-sorts by selected metric (Total Raised, Total Spent, Cash on Hand)
- **Simplified chart** - Removed complex click/hover interactions
  - Added dual Y-axis labels (left and right) for better readability
  - Removed legend (data now in list above)
  - Reduced chart height to 350px (supplementary role)

### Changed

#### Navigation Restructure
- **Removed** "Candidate Profile" and "Compare" as separate views
- **Three main dashboards**: "Leaderboard", "By District", "By Candidate"
- Updated navigation labels for clarity

#### Chart Simplification (QuarterlyChart.jsx)
- Removed all click/hover tooltip complexity
- Removed legend display
- Added dual Y-axis with currency formatting on both sides
- Increased line thickness to 2.5px for better visibility
- Reduced chart height from 400px to 350px

#### Name Display
- All candidate names now display in "First Last" format throughout app
- Applied `formatCandidateName()` in CandidateView search results and selected list
- Maintains title case formatting for readability

### Fixed
- **Search now works with both name formats**: "Mark Kelly" and "Kelly, Mark" both find results
- **All 2,866 candidates** now searchable (fixed Supabase 1,000 row limit)
- Ruben Gallego, Mark Kelly, and all other candidates now appear in search
- Multi-word searches work correctly (e.g., "Donald Trump" finds "TRUMP, DONALD J")

### Technical Details

#### Files Modified
- `/frontend/src/views/CandidateView.jsx` - Complete rewrite with search and batch fetching
- `/frontend/src/views/DistrictView.jsx` - Added party filters and ranked display
- `/frontend/src/components/QuarterlyChart.jsx` - Simplified, removed interactions
- `/frontend/src/components/layout/Navigation.jsx` - Updated to 3-tab structure
- `/frontend/src/App.jsx` - Removed ComparisonView route

#### Files Removed
- `/frontend/src/views/ComparisonView.jsx` - Functionality merged into CandidateView

#### Search Algorithm
- Word-based matching using `Array.every()` and `String.includes()`
- Splits search term into words and checks if all words appear in name or state
- Case-insensitive matching
- Handles middle initials and name variations

#### Data Fetching Optimization
- Implemented pagination with `.range(from, to)` for Supabase queries
- Fetches in 1,000 record batches until all candidates loaded
- Logs total candidate count to console

### Performance
- Initial load fetches ~2,866 candidates in 3 batches (~1-2 seconds)
- Search is instant (client-side filtering)
- No additional API calls during search

#### District Validation
